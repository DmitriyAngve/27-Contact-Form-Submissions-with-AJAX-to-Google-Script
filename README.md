# 27-Contact-Form-Submissions-with-AJAX-to-Google-Script

In this application I did a fully functional AJAX contact form.
The application has input fields and email filed a message area using textarea tag and a button to send the content.

Sending data adds it into a spreadsheet (Google Sheet).

The application uses Google App Script.

Unpretentious style included!
